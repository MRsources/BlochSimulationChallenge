# Phantoms

One 4 mm BrainWeb slab, cropped from the public [BIfTI registry](https://github.com/mrx-org/bifti-phantoms) BrainWeb 1 mm collection (`collection-brainweb-1mm`, Zenodo DOI `10.5281/zenodo.21822442`, tissue data `subj05-3T-1mm.json`). The NIfTI sform is the world placement.

| Slab             | 181 × 217 × 4 voxels, 1 mm isotropic                    |
| Voxel-to-world   | `[[1, 0, 0, -90], [0, 1, 0, -108], [0, 0, 1, -1.5]]` mm |

| Tissues          | gm, wm, csf, vessels, fat                               |

| File                              | What it is                                                               |

| `challenge-brain-4mm.json`        | Cases 0–3. `T2'` left out, so it is treated as infinite.                 |
| `challenge-brain-4mm-t2star.json` | Case 4. The same tissues, with the published `T2'`.                      |
| `subj05.nii.gz`                   | Densities for gm, wm, csf, vessels and fat.                              |
| `subj05_dB0.nii.gz`               | Off-resonance, including the fat chemical shift of −440 Hz.              |
| `subj05_B1+.nii.gz`               | Transmit map on the same grid. The challenge JSON does not reference it. |


The two JSON files differ only in `T2'`, which is what makes case 4 a T2* test. `T1`, `T2` and `dB0` are the published values. `B1+`, `B1-` and `ADC` are the BIfTI defaults (uniform 1, uniform 1, and 0). Those defaults are already written into the JSON, so every solver is given the same object.

The slab is centred on the world origin. [scripts/](scripts/) is the crop that wrote it, and the conversion of this slab to a KomaMRI phantom.
